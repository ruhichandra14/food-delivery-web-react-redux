# food-delivery-website
This is a food deliver website which fetches you the menu based on your location.It is made using reactJS and data binding through redux, also it makes use of react module such as geolocation and very effective and  useful 'JSON table' module.  Once on load the website gives you the default view .Then on search if the location is not found it gives you a message saying not available there and if the location is found it fetches you the menu at the location.However it currently works for address(typed-case insensitive) "HSR layout" due to JSON limitation.Need to work on it more ......  :)
